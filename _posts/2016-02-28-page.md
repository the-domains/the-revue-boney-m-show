# Why The reVue Boney M. Show?

The reVue Boney M. Show ... bringing you the greatest hits from Boney M., the most successful disco act of the Seventies with worldwide sales of 150 million records! Hits like: 
Rivers of Babylon
Daddy Cool
Ma Baker
Sunny
Rasputin
Brown Girl and many, many more!
The reVue ladies are the former lead and backing singers of Bobby Farrell's Boney M. Show! EDNA PROCTOR, MAUREEN FERNANDES, TAMZIE FRANSEN and JACQUELINE JONKERS, who all performed with the great Bobby Farrell within the last 12 years before he tragically passed away in December 2010 after a show in St. Petersburg, Russia ... a country where Boney M. was most popular as with many other countries around the whole world! 
The reVue ladies teamed up a year later with the fantastic, (originally from England, but now a resident of Amsterdam), singer/performer johnsonG! Formerly working as a backing-vocalist with Lionel Ritchie, Phil Collins and Ricky Martin, as well as a singer/dancer/choreographer for T.V. and shows in the Netherlands, johnsonG had already built an impressive career in showbizz.
The group received sensational reviews from promoters and crowds after shows in Holland, Belgium, Germany and Spain. And more recently in Barcelona and Galicia, when they headlined big open air summer festivals, the new front man's suave and polished vocals, dancing and good-looks did not go unnoticed either!
The reVue is a sensational disco group act that revives that disco pop groove with smooth moves by three experienced female singers in dazzling outfits together with the electrifying performance of johnsonG.
Their tribute to Bobby Farrell is to keep the Boney M. reVue alive!!!
